# Game is Hard – Level 19 (“I need some rest”) — Walkthrough + Mini Clone

Level 19 is the first “stop touching stuff” check that hard-punishes fidget hands.

## One-line solution (the whole level)
Put your phone flat on a solid table (screen up) and don’t touch it until the orange text turns green, then tap the green **Play** button.

## Recommended walkthrough (with screenshots)
If you want the cleanest reference (and images you can share), use:
- https://gameishard.org/level/19

It gives:
- The exact phrasing for the level
- A quick answer section
- Multiple screenshots showing the state change (orange → green) and the Play button appearing

## What’s in this repo
This repo is two things:
1. A fast, copy-paste-friendly writeup for **Level 19**
2. A tiny browser-based “clone” of the mechanic (flat + still → success)
